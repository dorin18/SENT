# SENT
SENT Transmission
The codes I published are for my engineering degree exam. They represent the SENT communication between two Arduino Uno boards.
The first board has the role of transciever (ECU) and the second board as a sensor.
The SENT library had to be made from scratch. You cand find more info by reading the SAE J2716, as my project is based from there.
Feel free to use my project for personal testing or developing it into a more complex application :)
